2.Require this mod in your own mod and write a script like this
3.Test and done

4.If you want to add things of your own, e.g side bus/tram station etc, do like following:

local rawData = station.dataCallback(config)
local function updateFn(params)
    result = rawData.updateFn(params)
    -- Add your own things
